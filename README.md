# Recipe Search Application

## Overview

This is a desktop recipe search application built with Python and Tkinter/CustomTkinter. The application appears to be designed with a modern Windows 11-inspired design system, featuring both light and dark themes. The app likely allows users to search for recipes, view recipe details, and manage their recipe collection through an intuitive graphical interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: Built using Python's Tkinter with CustomTkinter enhancements for modern UI components
- **Design System**: Implements Windows 11 design language with carefully defined color schemes for both light and dark modes
- **Image Handling**: Uses PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing, filtering, and display
- **Threading**: Implements multi-threading for non-blocking operations, likely for API calls and image loading

### User Interface Design
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Windows 11-inspired color palette with consistent theming
- **Responsive Components**: Uses ttk widgets and CustomTkinter for enhanced visual appeal
- **Dual Theme Support**: Comprehensive light and dark mode implementation with predefined color schemes
- **Rich Text Display**: Incorporates scrolled text widgets for displaying recipe content

### Application Structure
- **Single-Class Architecture**: Main application logic contained within `RecipeSearchApp` class
- **Event-Driven Design**: Built on Tkinter's event-driven model for user interactions
- **State Management**: Color themes and application state managed through instance variables

### Data Management
- **External API Integration**: Uses requests library for HTTP communication with recipe APIs
- **JSON Processing**: Handles recipe data in JSON format for structured information exchange
- **File Operations**: Supports file dialog operations for importing/exporting functionality
- **Local Storage**: Implements file-based storage for application data and user preferences

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **tkinter**: Native Python GUI toolkit for cross-platform desktop applications
- **customtkinter**: Modern UI enhancement library for improved visual components
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image processing library for recipe photos and visual enhancements
- **requests**: HTTP library for communicating with external recipe APIs

### System Integrations
- **Web Browser**: Integration for opening external links and recipe sources
- **File System**: Local file operations for data persistence and user file management
- **Threading**: Asynchronous operations for smooth user experience during API calls

### Potential External Services
